# Bitburner Scripts

## Getting Started

Take an Algorithms course at rothman university to boost hack level

Hack `n00dles` using

```
run deploy-attack.js n00dles --hacked-only
```

As you get some money buy the TOR router and buy scripts from the darkweb

```
connect darkweb
buy -l
buy -a
```

Also purchase servers for more RAM

```
run purchase-servers.js --verbose
```

When you have enough RAM you can attack a bigger target

```
run deploy-wgh.js --verbose
```

## Factions

backdoor these servers

```
run show-servers.js CSEC
run show-servers.js avmnite-02h
```

to share memory

```
run deploy-share.js
```
