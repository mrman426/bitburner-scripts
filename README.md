# Bitburner Scripts

## Getting Started

To get started hack `n00dles` using

```
run deploy-attack.js n00dles --hacked-only
```

As you get some money then purchase servers

```
run purchase-servers.js --verbose
```

When you have enough RAM you can attack a bigger target

```
run deploy-wgh.js --verbose
```
